# Diabetes_Prediction_ML
 
#This project aims to develop a machine learning-based model for predicting the risk of diabetes in patients. The
#model uses a dataset of patient information, including demographic, clinical, and lifestyle variables, to train and test
#several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines. The
#performance of each algorithm is evaluated based on several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and area
#under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The best-performing algorithm is selected as the final
#model, and its predictive performance is assessed on an independent test set.
#The results show that the machine learning-based model can accurately predict the risk of diabetes in patients. The
#model also identifies the most important predictors of diabetes risk, including age, body mass index, and family
#history of diabetes.
#In conclusion, the diabetes prediction model developed in this project has the potential to assist clinicians in
#identifying high-risk patients and implementing preventive interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes
#and reducing the burden of diabetes on healthcare systems.
